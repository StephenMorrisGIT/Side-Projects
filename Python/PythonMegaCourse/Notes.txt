Does white space matter in the code?
Yes. The following cases for example:
    1. When space is in front of a line of code
    2. When space is inside strings. Having white space inside a string will not produce any error but having white space in a string fundamentally changes the value. Ex: "Hello" != "Hello "
    3. When space occurs in a variable name. Ex: lastname is a valid variable name, last name is not

What happens if you create a variable two times in a program?
